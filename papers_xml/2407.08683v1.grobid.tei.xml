<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With the remarkable advancements in image generation and open-form text generation, the creation of interleaved image-text content has become an increasingly intriguing field. Multimodal story generation, characterized by producing narrative texts and vivid images in an interleaved manner, has emerged as a valuable and practical task with broad applications. However, this task poses significant challenges, as it necessitates the comprehension of the complex interplay between texts and images, and the ability to generate long sequences of coherent, contextually relevant texts and visuals. In this work, we propose SEED-Story, a novel method that leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate extended multimodal stories. Our model, built upon the powerful comprehension capability of MLLM, predicts text tokens as well as visual tokens, which are subsequently processed with an adapted visual de-tokenizer to produce images with consistent characters and styles. We further propose multimodal attention sink mechanism to enable the generation of stories with up to 25 sequences (only 10 for training) in a highly efficient autoregressive manner. Additionally, we present a large-scale and high-resolution dataset named StoryStream for training our model and quantitatively evaluating the task of multimodal story generation in various aspects. The models, codes and datasets are released in https://github.com/TencentARC/SEED-Story.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Interleaved image-text data is ubiquitous on the internet, characterized by multiple images interspersed with text. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in generating interleaved image-text content <ref type="bibr" coords="2,139.05,391.62,15.65,8.64" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,157.01,391.62,12.40,8.64" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,171.71,391.62,7.42,8.64" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,181.44,391.62,12.40,8.64" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,196.14,391.62,11.74,8.64" target="#b48">49]</ref>, driven by the remarkable advancements in image generation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,450.45,391.62,15.65,8.64" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,468.41,391.62,12.40,8.64" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,483.12,391.62,7.42,8.64" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,492.84,391.62,12.40,8.64" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,108.00,402.53,13.21,8.64" target="#b53">54]</ref> and open-form text generation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,243.36,402.53,15.65,8.64" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,261.24,402.53,12.40,8.64" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,275.87,402.53,7.83,8.64" target="#b58">59</ref>]. This has given rise to Multimodal Story Generation, an intriguing and valuable task that involves the generation of narrative texts and vivid images in an interleaved manner. This task goes beyond traditional text-based storytelling by fusing text and visuals to enrich narratives, creating a more immersive storytelling experience where visuals and text dynamically interact and complement each other.</p><p>However, multimodal story generation poses significant challenges due to the complexity of the inputs and the high demands on the quality of the outputs. Firstly, this task necessitates a thorough comprehension of interleaved data, where text is not only abstract and narrative in nature, but also deeply intertwined with complex images. The model must be adept at deciphering the intricate relationships between images and texts to maintain a coherent narrative flow. Secondly, this task requires the generation of not only a plausible text plot, but also visually captivating images that are consistent in characters and styles. The model should be capable of achieving coherence in the generation of both text and visuals, ensuring an engaging storytelling output.</p><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,341.41,555.31,15.81,8.64" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,359.71,555.31,12.47,8.64" target="#b59">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,374.67,555.31,12.47,8.64" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,389.64,555.31,7.49,8.64" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,399.62,555.31,12.47,8.64" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,414.58,555.31,12.47,8.64" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,429.54,555.31,12.47,8.64" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,444.51,555.31,13.30,8.64" target="#b21">22]</ref> have showcased powerful comprehension abilities in understanding multimodal data, which makes them ideally suited for interleaved image-text content in multimodal stories. Consequently, we introduce SEED-Story, a novel approach that builds upon the MLLM to harness its comprehension strength, while further equipping it with the capability to generate coherent images align with the narrative texts.</p><p>Specifically, following previous work <ref type="bibr" coords="2,266.50,615.33,15.89,8.64" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,285.79,615.33,11.92,8.64" target="#b15">16]</ref>, we utilize a pre-trained image tokenizer and detokenizer, which can decode realistic images with SD-XL <ref type="bibr" coords="2,337.05,626.24,16.50,8.64" target="#b40">[41]</ref> by taking the features of a pre-trained ViT as input. During training, given the interleaved visual and textual data, we adopt the next-word prediction and image feature regression training objectives to regularize multimodal generation. A fixed number of learnable queries are fed into the MLLM, where the output hidden states are trained to reconstruct the ViT features of the target images. To further enhance the consistency of characters and styles in generated images, we propose de-tokenizer adaptation, where the regressed image features from the MLLM are fed into the de-tokenizer for tuning SD-XL. This adaptation allows for better maintenance of coherence in low-level image details from the de-tokenizer, ensuring a more visually consistent storytelling output.</p><p>Furthermore, to enable the efficient generation of coherent long stories, we propose a multimodal attention sink mechanism based on window attention <ref type="bibr" coords="3,315.54,86.39,10.44,8.64" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, which maintains a fixed-size sliding window on the Key-Value (KV) states of the most recent tokens, as well as the beginning of text tokens, images tokens, and the end of image tokens. We empirically find that retaining these tokens will largely mitigate the model's failure with window attention when the token length surpasses the cache size, allowing our model to generalize to longer sequences than the training sequence length in an efficient manner. Our model with the proposed multimodal attention sink mechanism can generate long stories with up to 30 multimodal sequences, featuring rich text plots and diverse visual scenarios.</p><p>Additionally, we introduce a dataset named StoryStream for training and evaluating multimodal story generation. We design an automatic pipeline that leverages MLLMs to obtain a large-scale and high-resolution dataset featuring a sequence of narrative-rich texts and intriguing images, derived from animated videos. StoryStream is four times larger in terms of data volume compared to the existing largest story dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="3,226.43,211.87,15.42,8.64" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and it boasts higher image resolution, longer sequence lengths, and more detailed story narratives. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Story Visualization vs. Multimodal Story Generation The domain of story visualization, initially pioneered by StoryGAN <ref type="bibr" coords="3,207.82,380.48,15.26,8.64" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, has witnessed substantial advancements across various models focusing on improving image quality, narrative flow, and character consistency. StoryGAN introduced a framework based on sequential conditional GANs with dual discriminators that enhanced both narrative coherence and visual fidelity. Subsequent developments such as DuCoStoryGAN <ref type="bibr" coords="3,487.27,413.21,16.73,8.64" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and VLCStoryGAN <ref type="bibr" coords="3,193.99,424.12,16.73,8.64" target="#b30">[31]</ref> have integrated video captioning to better align text descriptions with corresponding visuals. The field has further expanded with the adoption of diffusion models aimed at refining the quality of generated story images. StoryDALL-E <ref type="bibr" coords="3,374.80,445.93,16.73,8.64" target="#b32">[33]</ref> utilizes pre-trained models augmented with cross-attention layers to support story progression from an initial image. Innovations like AR-LDM <ref type="bibr" coords="3,167.11,467.75,16.60,8.64" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and Story-LDM <ref type="bibr" coords="3,252.59,467.75,16.60,8.64" target="#b41">[42]</ref> have introduced auto-regressive diffusion models to create coherent sequences of images, while TaleCrafter <ref type="bibr" coords="3,308.13,478.66,16.73,8.64" target="#b16">[17]</ref> has employed LoRA and optimization techniques to ensure consistent characters throughout complex visual narratives. Intelligent Grimm <ref type="bibr" coords="3,487.43,489.57,16.57,8.64" target="#b26">[27]</ref> has proposed open-ended story visualization and has developed the auto-regressive model StoryGen, which includes a vision-language context module to further enhance character consistency. In contrast to all above, our work advances beyond story visualization by focusing on multimodal story generation. This approach continues the story with additional text and creates corresponding images, offering a richer, more engaging narrative experience into the story generation process.</p></div>

StoryGPTV requires character and object masks for training its LDM. In contrast, our model, with the visual tokenization and de-tokenization, have a stronger visual comprehension ability, making it trains directly from interleaved text and image data without the need for masks. MM-interleaved <ref type="bibr" coords="3,459.85,634.27,16.47,8.64" target="#b51">[52]</ref> design an MMFS module to process interleaved text-image data and achieve multimodal story generation through image features and LLM output. While our approach directly generates images through LLM output tokens. We take MM-interleaved as an important baseline and compare with it.</p><p>Visual Story Dataset In the landscape of datasets for visual storytelling, various collections have been developed. The VIST <ref type="bibr" coords="3,226.33,702.61,16.73,8.64" target="#b19">[20]</ref> dataset is noteworthy for its use of realistic images, though it struggles with maintaining character consistency across stories. The Pororo <ref type="bibr" coords="3,406.42,713.51,16.48,8.64" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and Flintstones <ref type="bibr" coords="3,487.52,713.51,16.48,8.64" target="#b17">[18]</ref>  datasets, while popular for animation-based story datasets, are hindered by their low resolution and the simplicity of their accompanying texts. Another significant dataset is StorySalon <ref type="bibr" coords="4,456.99,213.39,15.42,8.64" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, which offers high-resolution images and is large in scale, but it lacks global consistency across a series of images. To address these gaps, we introduce StoryStream, a globally consistent, large-scale, high-resolution animated style dataset with engaging, narrative-rich text for complex storytelling, overcoming the limitations of existing datasets. The analysis is shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,423.95,257.03,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p><p>3 Method</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Story Generation with Multimodal Large Language Model</head><p>Visual Tokenization and De-tokenization The overview of our method is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,498.21,332.39,3.77,8.64" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>To effectively extend visual stories, our model must comprehend and generate both images and text. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in generative MLLMs that unify image comprehension and generation <ref type="bibr" coords="4,170.89,365.12,15.41,8.64" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, we develop a multimodal story generation model. Our model employs a pretrained Vision Transformer <ref type="bibr" coords="4,223.10,376.03,16.73,8.64" target="#b11">[12]</ref> (ViT) as the visual tokenizer and a pre-trained diffusion model as the visual de-tokenizer to decode images by using ViT's features as inputs. Specifically, visual embeddings from the ViT tokenizer are fed into a learnable module, which then serves as inputs for the U-Net of the pre-trained SD-XL <ref type="bibr" coords="4,252.46,408.76,15.21,8.64" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. This process replaces the original text features with visual embeddings. During this stage, the parameters are optimized using open-world text-image pair data as well as story data to enhance the model's encoding-decoding capability. After this training phase, we expect the visual tokenizer and de-tokenizer modules to preserve as much image information as possible in the feature space.</p><p>Story Instruction Tuning In our instruction tuning process for story generation, we sample a random-length subset of a story data point for each iteration. The model is tasked with predicting the next image and the next sentence of the story text. Within MLLM, all images are converted into image features using a pre-trained ViT tokenizer. For the target text tokens, we perform next-token prediction and use Cross Entropy loss to train for this discrete target. For the target image features, the model uses a series of learnable queries as inputs and continuously outputs a series of latent embeddings. We then compute the cosine similarity loss between the MLLM's output and the target image features. During this stage, we fine-tune the SEED-Story model using a LoRA <ref type="bibr" coords="4,449.78,546.61,16.60,8.64" target="#b18">[19]</ref> module.</p><p>De-tokenizer Adaptation After instruction tuning, the SEED-Story MLLM effectively produces story images with correct semantics but lacks style consistency and details. We attribute this issue to the misalignment between the latent space of the MLLM output and the image features. To address this, we perform de-tokenizer adaptation for style and texture alignment. In this stage, only the SD-XL image de-tokenizer is trained. Conditioned on the MLLM output embeddings, SD-XL is expected to generate images that are pixel-level aligned with the ground truth. The separate training of the de-tokenizer offers two key advantages. First, it avoids optimization conflicts between the LLM and the de-tokenizer. Second, it conserves memory, making the process executable on GPUs with limited memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Long Story Generation with Multimodal Attention Sink</head><p>Generating long visual stories has substantial potential in various applications, including education and entertainment. However, creating these stories with MLLMs presents significant challenges. Datasets for extended, interleaved stories are not only rare but also impede the training process due  to their complexity. To address this, we have to employ a train-short-test-long approach, training models on shorter narratives and extending to longer generations during inference. Moreover, during inference, generating significantly longer stories than the training data often leads to model degradation, producing lower-quality images, as illustrated in the first row of Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,493.04,593.46,8.47,8.64" target="#fig_0">10</ref>. This process also requires extensive token usage to ensure continuity and coherence, which in turn increases memory and computational demands.</p><p>A simplistic solution for this is to use a sliding window technique, depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,461.27,631.67,5.08,8.64" target="#fig_2">3</ref> right (b). However, this method disrupts the token relationships in the Key-Value (KV) cache, resulting in subpar generative outcomes, as demonstrated by StreamingLLM <ref type="bibr" coords="5,343.21,653.49,15.42,8.64" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. To overcome this, StreamingLLM introduces an attention sink mechanism that preserves the initial tokens, thus allowing for efficient processing of lengthy generations without quality compromise. While effective in language models, its efficacy diminishes in multimodal contexts, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,373.70,686.22,4.98,8.64" target="#fig_2">3</ref> right (c).</p><p>To enhance long multimodal generation, we revisit the attention maps of MLLMs. After conducting numerous experiments across various models and cases, we analyze the attention maps across different layers and heads. Our analysis reveals that most queries predominantly focus on four types of tokens:</p><p>(1) starting tokens, (2) punctuation tokens, (3) beginning-of-image (BoI) tokens, and ( <ref type="formula" coords="6,441.60,386.55,3.79,8.64">4</ref>) end-of-image (EoI) tokens. Unlike language-only models, MLLMs place considerable attention on specific image tokens, particularly those near the BoI and EoI, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,390.69,408.37,4.98,8.64" target="#fig_2">3</ref> left.</p><p>Building on these insights, we propose a new mechanism for extended generation in MLLMs, termed the multimodal attention sink. During generation, we consistently retain the starting tokens and the image tokens adjacent to the BoI and EoI. Although punctuation tokens receive high attention values, their latent value norms are minimal, contributing insignificantly to the final output, so we do not keep them, as noted by <ref type="bibr" coords="6,203.07,468.40,15.37,8.64" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Our proposed mechanism enables our model to generate high-quality images while maintaining a low computational footprint.</p><p>4 StoryStream Dataset</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Dataset Construction</head><p>An ideal source for creating a multimodal story generation dataset is cartoon series, which inherently contain rich plots and consistent character portrayals. We selected three cartoon series to construct our dataset and we present the Curious George in the main body of our paper. The process begins with collecting various series, from which we extract keyframes and their associated subtitles <ref type="bibr" coords="6,486.53,588.04,15.37,8.64" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Each keyframe is then processed by GPT-4V <ref type="bibr" coords="6,296.95,598.94,16.73,8.64" target="#b33">[34]</ref> or Qwen-VL <ref type="bibr" coords="6,372.74,598.94,11.75,8.64" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to generate a detailed image description. These elements-keyframe, subtitle, and description-are compiled into a single group. We aggregate 30 such groups and input them into GPT-4, supplemented with background information about the cartoon series. Following our instructions, GPT-4 generates high-quality narrative texts suitable for training story generation models.</p><p>During dataset construction, we discovered that employing the above chain of thought approach not only produces more accurate narrative text but also speeds up the construction process. Unlike directly feeding all images directly to GPT-4, which is limited to 10 images due to API constrains, our approach produces longer stories. We also significantly improve the model's understanding of each image by incorporating detailed descriptions. This enhancement in image comprehension enriches the narrative details, providing a richer story generation reference.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Key Features</head><p>Large-scale. Our StoryStream dataset comprises three subsets totaling 257,850 released images. This represents a significant improvement over existing datasets in terms of scale, specific numbers are presented in column 2 of Table <ref type="table" coords="7,254.76,629.28,3.81,8.64" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. To the best of my knowledge, it is the largest visual story generation dataset featuring consistent main characters. High Resolution. Unlike existing story generation datasets, such as Flintstones and Pororo, which offer images at a resolution of 128x128, our story stream dataset provides high-resolution images of 480x768. Narrative Text. Our dataset diverges from existing ones that utilize simple and descriptive language. We offer abstract, narrative, detailed, and story-toned texts that are more akin to real-world applications, such as visualizing narratives from a storybook, examples are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,472.46,713.51,3.70,8.64">4</ref>. Story text of existing datasets obey the form of "name" + "action", like "Poby is playing the violin.". Contrarily, our story text involves more intrinsic elements. This effectively enhances the engagement of audiences. An analysis of the average text length per sentence is shown in column 5 of Table <ref type="table" coords="8,490.81,97.30,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p><p>Long Sequence. Moreover, our dataset enhances long story comprehension by offering up to 30 images per story point. Within these 30 images, our corresponding texts present a cohesive narrative, effectively conveying the progression and intricacies of extended stories.   Previous story generation approaches primarily utilize diffusion models, focusing on visualizing story images. These models take the previous image and text as input, and then generate only the next image based on the current text prompt. For a fair comparison, we adapt our model to a visualization-only format. For StoryGen <ref type="bibr" coords="8,284.80,483.45,15.12,8.64" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, we also train it to produce images with previous images and texts. For LDM <ref type="bibr" coords="8,379.38,494.35,15.19,8.64" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, we only give it text-image pairs. The visual results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,287.15,505.26,3.73,8.64" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. SEED-Story model shows better style and character consistency and higher quality compared to baselines. We also conduct a quantitative evaluation in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,132.07,527.08,4.98,8.64" target="#tab_3">2</ref> to demonstrate our effectiveness. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Multimodal Story Generation</head><p>For comparative analysis, there are relatively few established methods for generating multimodal stories. To establish a baseline for comparison, we fine-tune the recently developed MM-interleaved model on our dataset. We detail the comparative results in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,371.09,119.26,3.75,8.64" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. The FID is employed to assess the visual quality of the generated images. Additionally, we ask GPT-4V to compare and choose a preferred option between each of the generation results of MM-interleaved and SEED-Story across several dimensions: Style Consistency, which evaluates the stylistic uniformity across different images; Story Engagement, which measures the ability of narratives to captivate and maintain audience interest; and Image-Text Coherence, which assesses the alignment and relevance between images and their accompanying texts. The appendix presents our visual results and details about prompt engineering methods.</p><p>For qualitative presentation, we demonstrate our SEED-story effectively helps users control the story plot. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,180.07,222.92,4.99,8.64" target="#fig_9">7</ref> shows that using the same starting image but different initial texts, the narrative branches into two distinct storylines.</p><p>We provide more cases in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,247.88,250.22,5.08,8.64" target="#fig_10">8</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,303.86,250.22,5.08,8.64">9</ref> to prove our multimodal long story generation capabilities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I Limitations</head><p>Lack of Realistic Data Experimentation: This limitation points to a potential gap in the validation of the SEED-Story model under practical, real-world conditions. Without experiments using realistic data, it's difficult to ascertain how the model would perform in scenarios that are not perfectly controlled or that deviate from the training conditions. This can be crucial, especially in applications like storytelling where the context and variability of real-world data play significant roles. A possible solution would be to incorporate a broader range of test conditions, including noisy data or data from "in-the-wild" storytelling scenarios, to evaluate the robustness and adaptability of the model.</p><p>Training on a Non-Diverse Dataset: The second limitation is the restriction of the model's training to animation datasets which does not cover a large scale or diverse styles. This can severely limit the model's ability to generalize and produce outputs in styles that are not represented in the training data. This is particularly limiting in creative tasks such as storytelling where the ability to adapt to various artistic and narrative styles is crucial. To mitigate this, expanding the dataset to include a wider array of styles, genres, and visual aesthetics could be beneficial.</p><p>a) The man looked to the side with a surprised expression.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A Implementation Details A.1 Visual Tokenization and De-tokenization</head><p>For visual tokenization, we use Qwen-VL pre-trained ViT-G. We first resize the image to 448x448 images and then use ViT to produce its feature of length256 with 4096 dimension. (shape: <ref type="bibr" coords="17,484.08,154.50,21.17,8.64">[256,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,107.65,165.41,20.54,8.64">4096]</ref>). Inside the MLLM, we use a Q-Former architecture to process the image embedding. It takse the ViT image feature as key and Value, and conduct attention with its learnable queries. The length of learnable queries are 64. For de-tokenization, we also use a Q-Former architecture to transform the MLLM output to the shape of SD-XL condition embedding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2 Instruction Tuning</head><p>Instruction tuning data is formatted as follows: for each story, we sample a random length and compute losses on the last sequence (highlighted in red text). The sequence format is structured as: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. [target sequence]&lt;eos&gt;</head><p>For our language model (LLM), we utilize the LLAMA2-7B pre-trained model and finetune it using LoRA, supported by the peft library. The hyperparameter r is set to 6, and lora_alpha is set to 32. The modules optimized include the q_projection_layer, v_projection_layer, k_projection_layer, o_projection_layer, gate_projection_layer, down_projection_layer, and up_projection_layer. We employ a learning rate of 1 × 10 -4 to finetune this model on our dataset across approximately 6 epochs, utilizing 8 NVIDIA-A800 GPUs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3 De-tokenizer Adaptation</head><p>In this stage we fully finetune the SD-XL model. The data format is as the same as instruction tuning, but we fix all MLLM params and optimize only the SD-XL. It takes the MLLM output and is asked to produce image correspond to the ground truth. The SD-XL model was trained using 4 NVIDIA-A800 GPUs. A learning rate of 1 × 10 -4 was chosen to facilitate gradual weight updates, ensuring stable convergence, while a weight decay of 0.03 was applied for regularization to prevent overfitting. Training was performed using mixed precision (bf16), which significantly reduced memory usage and accelerated the training process without compromising the model's accuracy. The model underwent three training epochs, balancing the learning of complex patterns against computational resource use, optimized for large-scale datasets and sophisticated model architectures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B Attention Map Visualization</head><p>In this section, we present additional visualizations of attention maps. These maps are derived from various model runs, including varying data lengths, attention heads, and layers. The visualizations consistently reveal a pattern of attention focused on '0' tokens, punctuation, tokens adjacent to Begin-of-Image (BoI), and tokens adjacent to End-of-Image (EoI).</p></div>
